## WALT v1.0 ##

***WALT*** (Wildcard ALignment Tool) is a read mapping program for bisulfite sequencing in DNA methylation studies.

### Requirements ###

Currently WALT requires a C++ compiler that supports the C++11
standard. The default compiler assumed is g++ (from GCC, available on
your Linux or OS X machine). The g++ compiler has supported the C++11
standard since roughly 2012 (GCC 4.7) so this should not cause any
problems. WALT also requires OMP libraries and headers to be
available, which rarely causes problems.

If you have trouble with the "make" part of the installation procedure
described below, please contact us.

### Installation ###
(1) Download the source code from Github

    git clone git@github.com:smithlabcode/walt.git

(2) Build and Install

    cd walt
    make all
    make install

### Examples ###

(1) **Indexing Genome**

For example, to make an index for UCSC hg19

    makedb -c hg19/ -o hg19.dbindex

or to make an index for chromosome 2

    makedb -c chr2.fa -o chr2.dbindex

The suffix of the index file should be '.dbindex'.

(2) **Bisulfite Mapping**

For example, to mapping reads to human genome hg19

    walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_1.fq -o reads_1_mapping.sam

If mapping the reads from the *_2 reads file, the -A option should be
set. This means that all Gs in the reads and genome are converted to
As. If -A option is not set, all Cs in the reads and genome are
converted to Ts.

    walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_2.fq -A -o reads_2_mapping.sam


If mapping post-bisulfite adaptor tagging reads (PBAT), the -P option
should be set.

    walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_2.fq -P -o reads_2_mapping.sam
    walt -i hg19.dbindex -1 read_1.fq -2 read_2.fq -P -o paired_mapping_PBAT.sam

Additionally, WALT supports comma-separated list of read files. WALT
produces one mapping output file for each read file. For single-end
mapping, the output file names will be appended "_s1", "_s2", and so
on. Notice: except the first file path, all other file paths cannot
use '~'. For example, "-r ~/read_file1.fq,~/read_file2.fq" is not
allowed. It should be "-r ~/read_file1.fq,/home/read_file2.fq", since
linux system doesn't know it is a path except the first one.

     walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_file1.fq,read_file2.fq,read_file3.fq -o reads_1_mapping.sam

For paired-end reads, -1 and -2 options are used for the mate read files.

    walt -i hg19.dbindex -1 read_1.fq -2 read_2.fq -o paired_mapping.sam

Similarly, WALT supports comma-separated list of read files for
paired-end mapping. WALT produces one mapping output file for each
pair of read files. The output file names will be appended "_p1",
"_p2", and so on. One other thing to note is the mate 1 and mate 2
paired files should be in the same order.

     walt -i hg19.dbindex -1 read_file1_1.fq,read_file2_1.fq,read_file3_1.fq \
                          -2 read_file1_2.fq,read_file2_2.fq,read_file3_2.fq \
                          -o paired_mapping.sam

The default number of maximum allowed mismatches is 6. The maximum
allowed mismatches can be set using -m option.

    walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_1.fq -m 4 -o reads_1_mapping.sam

The option -N sets the number of reads to mapping in each loop. If N
is larger, the program takes large memory, especially for paired-end
mapping. For Human Genome, if N is 1000000, both single-end and
paired-end mapping take about 16 Gb memory. If N is 5000000,
single-end mapping takes about 18 Gb memory, while paired-end mapping
takes about 28 Gb memory. If N is set to be larger than 10000000, the
program will set N to be 10000000 since when N is too large the
program will take large memory but it will not be significantly
faster. The estimate memory for single-end mapping is 15 + N * (2 *
rl + rnl + 16) / (1024^3) Gb, and for paired-end mapping is 15 + N *
(4 * rl + 2 * rnl + 24 * k + 16) / (1024^3) Gb. The index size of
human genome is about 15 Gb. N is the number of reads to map in one
loop. rl is the length of reads (WALT supports mix of different
lengths reads, so here rl is estimation of the average length). rnl is
the length of read names. k is maximum allowed mappings for a read in
paired-end mapping.

    walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_1.fq -N 1000000 -o reads_1_mapping.sam

To output the ambiguous mapped reads or unmapped reads, -u and -a
options should be set. If the output format is MR, the ambigous mapped
reads and unmapped reads will output to a separated file,
respectively. For paired-end mapping, there will be a unmapped file
and an ambiguous file for each of the mate 1 and mate 2 reads file. If
the output format is SAM, uniquely mapped, ambiguous mapped, unmapped
reads are output to the same file with different FLAGs.

    walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_1.fq -u -a -o reads_1_mapping.sam

To trim 3' end adaptor sequence, -C option should be set. For
paired-end read mapping, using T_adaptor[:A_adaptor] format to set the
adaptor. If only one adaptor seqeunce is given, the same adaptor
sequence will be used for both T-rech and A-rich reads.

    walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_1.fq -C AGATCGGAAGAGC -o reads_1_mapping.sam
    walt -i hg19.dbindex -r read_2.fq -A -C AGATCGGAAGAGC -o reads_2_mapping.sam
    walt -i hg19.dbindex -1 read_1.fq -2 read_2.fq -C AGATCGGAAGAGC -o paired_mapping.sam
    walt -i hg19.dbindex -1 read_1.fq -2 read_2.fq -C AGATCGGAAGAGC:AGATCGG -o paired_mapping.sam

By default, WALT produces SAM format files. If you plan to get MR
file, please make sure the suffix of the output file is ".mr".

     walt -i hg19.dbindex -1 read_1.fq -2 read_2.fq -o paired_mapping.mr

WALT produces a separate mapping statistics file (.mapstats) for each
run. It includes percentages of uniquely mapped, ambiguously mapped
and unmapped reads.

### Output Format ###

WALT supports Tab-delimited SAM and MR output formats. By default,
WALT produces SAM format output files. To get MR format, the suffix of
the output file should be ".mr".

**SAM Format**

* QNAME (read name)
* FLAG (bitwise FLAG)
* RNAME (chromosome name)
* POS (start position, 1-based, 0 means unmapped)
* MAPQ (255 in WALT)
* CIGAR (CIGAR string)
* RNEXT (chromosome name of the mate read)
* PNEXT (start position of the mate read)
* TLEN (observed segment length)
* SEQ (read sequence)
* QUAL (quality sequence read from fastq file)
* NM-tag (number of mismatches)

By default, WALT only outputs uniquely mapped reads. If -u or -a
option is set, the ambiguous mapped or unmapped reads will be in the
same SAM file with different FLAGs. The FLAG 0x100 will be set for
ambiguous mapped reads, and the FLAG 0x4 will be set for unmapped
reads.

**The Mapped Read (MR) Format**

This format retains less total information than is typically in a BAM
file, but has all the information required for typical downstream DNA
methylation analysis.
* RNAME (chromosome name)
* SPOS (start position, 0-based)
* EPOS (end position, 0-based)
* QNAME (read name)
* MISMATCH (number of mismatches)
* STRAND (forward or reverse strand)
* SEQ
* QUAL

If paired-end reads are mapped in proper pair, the QNAME is added
"FRAG:" in the beginning of the read name, the STRAND is the strand of
the first mate mapped and SEQ and QUAL is merged according to their
mapping positions. The overlap segment of SEQ and QUAL is from the
mate 1 or mate 2 and it is the one with less number of 'N' in the read
sequence. MISMATCH is the sum of mismatches in the mate 1 and
mismatches in the mate 2. If paired-end reads are not mapped in proper
pair, they are treated as single-end reads. If -u and/or -a option is
set, the ambiguous mapped or unmapped reads are output in separate
files.
